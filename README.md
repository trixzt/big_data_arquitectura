# Big Data Architecture Proyect

🏠 The purpose of this project is to propose a DAaaS (Data Analytics-as-a-Service) design that enables real estate agencies and potential buyers to obtain comprehensive information from various property listing websites.
This information includes details on property price, type, number of rooms, location, parking availability, size, listing agency, images, and publication date.

🏡Currently, numerous real estate platforms exist online, making the search process increasingly tedious as users navigate each site individually. 
This project aims to streamline the search process by aggregating information from multiple sources,
allowing interested parties to efficiently find the property characteristics they are looking for without the need to search across multiple websites
